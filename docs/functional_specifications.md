# Functional Specifications for a MVP

## Introduction
This document describes the functional specifications of the Vauban project.

## Security Requirements

### Sec_Req 1 : Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- **Description** : Require additional authentication such as OTP, TOTP, SMS, or authenticator apps (OATH).

### Sec_Req 2 : Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- **Description** : Define specific roles and permissions to control who can access which servers and what actions they can perform.

### Sec_Req 3 : Activity Logging and Auditing
- **Description** : Record all connections, executed commands, and actions taken on servers for comprehensive auditing.

### Sec_Req 4 : Tunnel and Connection Encryption
- **Description** : Use secure protocols like TLS to encrypt RDP, VNC, and SSH connections.

### Sec_Req 5 : Session Isolation
- **Description** : Ensure user sessions are isolated from each other to prevent interference or information leakage.

## Traceability and Auditing Requirements

### Aud_Req 1 : Session Recording
- **Description** : Capture video or textual recordings of sessions for later review and analysis.

### Aud_Req 2 : Real-Time Monitoring
- **Description** : Allow administrators to monitor sessions in real-time to detect any suspicious or unauthorized activity.

### Aud_Req 3 : Security Alerts
- **Description** : Configure alerts for specific events such as repeated failed login attempts or suspicious actions.

### Aud_Req 4 : Audit Reports
- **Description** : Generate detailed reports of user activities, including executed commands, accessed files, etc.

## Management and Control Requirements

### Mgt_Req 1 : Granular Command Control
- **Description** : Allow restriction or authorization of specific commands for certain users or groups.

### Mgt_Req 2 : Just-In-Time (JIT) Access
- **Description** : Provide temporary, time-limited access to servers to reduce the risk of compromise.

### Mgt_Req 3 : Multi-Protocol Support
- **Description** : Support RDP, VNC, and SSH connections with centralized management.

### Mgt_Req 4 : Integration with Enterprise Directories
- **Description** : Integrate with LDAPS, Active Directory, and other centralized authentication systems.

### Mgt_Req 5 : Key and Certificate Management
- **Description** : Centralize the management of SSH keys and certificates to prevent uncontrolled distribution of these sensitive elements.

## Minimum Technical Requirements

### Tec_Req 1 : Multi-OS Compatibility
- **Description** : Support Linux, FreeBSD, and other common UNIX operating systems.

### Tec_Req 2 : Scalability
- **Description** : Handle a large number of simultaneous connections without performance degradation.

### Tec_Req 3 : Intuitive User Interface
- **Description** : Offer a clear and easy-to-use interface for administrators and end users.

### Tec_Req 4 : Comprehensive Documentation
- **Description** : Provide detailed documentation for installation, configuration, and use of the software.

### Tec_Req 5 : Security Updates
- **Description** : Have a mechanism for frequent and automatic updates to quickly patch vulnerabilities.

## Recommended Additional Requirements

### Opt_Req 1 : Sandboxing
- **Description** : Run user sessions in isolated environments to limit the impact of potential compromises.

### Opt_Req 2 : Behavioral Analysis
- **Description** : Use machine learning algorithms to detect abnormal or malicious behaviors.

### Opt_Req 3 : Backup and Recovery
- **Description** : Implement mechanisms for backing up and recovering configurations and audit logs.
